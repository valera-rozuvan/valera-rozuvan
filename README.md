### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The world is full of problems. Pick one, and concentrate on it. Try to make a difference. Make sure you understand just what it is you are trying to achieve.

My online home is [valera.rozuvan.net](https://valera.rozuvan.net/) - among other places.

Just a humble reminder, remember to [Keep Stuff Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (KISS principle).

It's 2025. Take a good look around, there is so-o-o much stuff to do and learn. On to code, then ;)
